# Argonis: Enterprise Documentation Management System ðŸ§™

## Project Overview

Argonis is an innovative, open-source documentation management system designed to streamline and optimize access to enterprise documentation. It addresses the common challenge of scattered and outdated information in organizations by providing a centralized, code-first approach to documentation management.

## Key Features (MVP)

1. **Doc-as-Code Platform**: Built on a foundation emphasizing a code-first approach to documentation.
2. **Authentication and Access Management**: Robust layer for secure access control and user management.
3. **Internal Document Editor**: Built-in editor for creating and modifying documentation directly within the platform. Changes are transformed into PRs, commits, or other formats depending on the configuration.
4. **Watcher System**: Intelligent system that monitors specific Git repositories for changes and suggests documentation updates based on code changes.
5. **Unified Search**: Seamless search functionality across all documentation within the platform.
6. **Version Control**: Integrated version control for all documentation, leveraging Git.
7. **AI-Assisted Post-Editing**: AI assistant to suggest links, content references, rephrasing, and translations.

## Deployment and Availability

- **Self-hosted**: Designed to be deployed on-premises or in a private cloud environment.
- **Open Source**: Freely available and open for community contributions.
- **Flexible Deployment Options**: 
  - Standard installer for traditional setups.
  - Docker container provided for easy deployment and scaling (Kubernetes-friendly).

## Architecture

Argonis employs a modular, scalable architecture designed for performance and flexibility.

```

## Workflow

1. **Content Creation and Editing**:
   - Users create or edit documentation using the internal editor or external tools
   - Changes are committed to the Git repository or transformed into PRs based on configuration

2. **Watcher System Monitoring**:
   - Watcher system observes configured Git repositories for changes
   - When changes are detected, it analyzes commits and pull requests

3. **Documentation Update Suggestions**:
   - Watcher system generates suggestions for documentation updates based on code changes
   - Users are notified of suggested updates via the platform, email, or other configured methods

4. **AI-Assisted Editing**:
   - AI assistant provides suggestions for links, references, rephrasing, and translations during the editing process

5. **Search and Retrieval**:
   - Users can search for documentation using the unified search interface
   - Results are filtered based on user permissions

## Roadmap

### Immediate Post-MVP Plans:

1. **Mobile Application**: 
   - Develop Android and iOS apps for on-the-go access to documentation

2. **Dynamic Documentation Generation**:
   - Implement system for creating adaptive content based on user needs and queries

### Future Enhancements:

1. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement usage analytics to identify valuable content and areas for improvement.
2. **Integration with Communication Tools**: Connect with platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams for seamless information sharing.
3. **AI-Powered Insights**: Implement machine learning models to provide content recommendations and identify knowledge gaps.
